"<br><b>Why not port 5222?</b><br><br>* ConverseJS for Ubuntu Touch uses a "
"pure Javascript client that was designed to run in a web-browser. It "
"therefore cannot directly connect to port 5222 like other XMPP clients.<br>* "
"You need to consult with your XMPP server admin regarding the URL of the "
"Websocket or BOSH connection. Modern XMPP servers usually have it enabled, "
"but it might not be as simple as the placeholder suggests.<br>* In a future "
"version (6+) ConverseJS will attempt to auto discover these alternative "
"connection methods.<br><br><b>Websocket connections</b><br><br>* This is the "
"recommended connection method.<br>* By default newer Ejabberd servers are "
"configured to expose it on 'wss://example.com/ws/'. This assumes the server "
"uses transport encryption. Userwise use 'ws://example.com/ws/'.<br>* You "
"might have to add the port like this: 'wss://example.com:5280/ws/' or "
"similar.<br>* Smacks management is enabled by default.<br><br><b>BOSH "
"connections</b><br><br>* Fallback option for older XMPP servers.<br>* By "
"default newer Ejabberd servers are configured to expose it on 'https://"
"example.com/bosh/'. This assumes the server uses transport encryption. "
"Userwise use 'http://example.com/bosh/'.<br>* For Prosody servers it might "
"also be: 'http://example.com:5280/http-bind/' or similar.<br>* If both a "
"Websocket and a BOSH URL is set, the Websocket connection will be used if "
"possible.<br>"
